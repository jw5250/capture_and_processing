## PART 1 

Design Decisions:

Entry point is main.py.
    May require running "source capture_and_processing_venv/bin/activate" before running the actual program due to use of matplotlib

packetParts.txt contains each packet's first n bytes. Each line contains these bytes. There are no separators between bytes on each line.

The k12 text file is expected to have come from a file from Wireshark, NOT tshark.
    The reason for this is that tshark's interpretation of a k12 text file is different from that of Wireshark's.

The end extension, however, is expected to be .txt.

When writing to files, the program will produce a pcapng file called "capture<x>.pcapng", which is an actual .pcapng file. "X" is the nth file produced (indexed like arrays where the first element is at the zeroth position in memory)

The reason we didn't have tshark produce a k12 file is because tshark's interpretation of such does not produce any hex that could be easily converted into a packet's representation as a byte string, unlike Wireshark.

We interpreted the "select number of files to be created" as creating 3 files, each containing 100 packets.

We interpreted the "number of bytes to save from each packet" as the amount of bytes to save from each packet from each file.
    The bytes of each packet are separated based on which file they came from. The file name scheme is "packetParts<x>.txt", where the x corresponds with the packet's respective capture<x>.pcapng file.

The summary statistics are applied to all packets across all files. Thus, the total amount of packets included in them is <number of packets to be captured> * <number of files requested>.

The final summary statistics output is to output.txt.

# PART 2 ADDITIONS

### Required:

1. Visualization of the packet arrival time was done through calculating the amount of time the n+1th packet took
relative to the nth packet. Thus, the first packet is not associated with a packet arrival time.

2. The checksum portion of our project provides summary information about IPv4 header checksum validation.

3. We added the additional required metadata about the capture (number of packets, time span, avg packet
size, total bytes – IP payloads)

Additional features choosen:
    1. Protocol Distribution
        Was already part of the original project.
        The output report the counts of IPv4, IPv6, TCP, UDP, and ICMP protocols.
    2. Summary Statistics on the packet arrival times
        Packet arrival times are calculated based on the amount of time a packet took to arrive after the arrival of the previous one. The first packet is not counted in, as its value is always zero.
    3. Protocol Distribution Visualization
        The distribution of protocols among all packets is visualized as a pie chart.
        Only checks the distribution of IPv4, IPv6, ICMP, TCP, and UDP packets.

k12 file example (individual bytes of each packet are only separated by |, NOT newlines as displayed in this doc):
