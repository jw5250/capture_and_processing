Design Decisions:

Entry point is main.py.

packetParts.txt contains each packet's first n bytes. Each line contains these bytes. There are no separators between bytes on each line.

The k12 text file is expected to have come from a file from Wireshark, NOT tshark.
    The reason for this is that tshark's interpretation of a k12 text file is different from that of Wireshark's.

The end extension, however, is expected to be .txt.

When writing to files, the program will produce a pcapng file called "capture<x>.pcapng", which is an actual .pcapng file. "X" is the nth file produced (indexed like arrays where the first element is at the zeroth position in memory)

The reason we didn't have tshark produce a k12 file is because tshark's interpretation of such does not produce any hex that could be easily converted into a packet's representation as a byte string, unlike Wireshark.

We interpreted the "select number of files to be created" as creating 3 files, each containing 100 packets.

We interpreted the "number of bytes to save from each packet" as the amount of bytes to save from each packet from each file.
    The bytes of each packet are separated based on which file they came from. The file name scheme is "packetParts<x>.txt", where the x corresponds with the packet's respective capture<x>.pcapng file.

The final summary statistics output is to output.txt.


k12 file example (individual bytes of each packet are only separated by |, NOT newlines as displayed in this doc):
